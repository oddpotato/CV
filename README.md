## Fiona Apps

I am a long-time <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Panyd">Wikipedia administrator</a>, artist, and online community manager with extensive knowledge about online extremism. I am in the process of learning to code to help in the fight against bad faith actors, and hope to one day be part of a team whose design principles include provisions to counter radicalization. 

I would also love to join in on more Open Source projects. Copyleft is responsible for so many amazing leaps forward in tech, and although I have extensive experience creating articles and images, I have yet to contribute to code.

## Skills

I have been involved in QA testing and bug reporting in multiple environments. As part of a small startup team, I have had the opportunity to design and test product features myself. I also have experience QA testing from Dev, to Production, and (unfortunately) Live. I understand the importance of attention to detail and providing thorough and clear explanations of problems.

More importantly, QA testing has given me an appreciation for 'unknown unknowns', the best laid plans will be scuppered by users behaving in ways we can't predict. I believe this is of utmost importance throughout the planning and programming process.

#### Laptop and Computer Repair

Throughout my working life I have been a part of IT teams, helping to fix hardware and software issues. This has included writing documentation for new hires for training purposes but also to ensure best practices are followed throughout the department. My specialty has traditionally been laptops and office supplies (printers/projectors).

#### Software Experience/Proficiencies
My experience with each of these is as a front-end user and Product Manager. Although I have yet to write any code linked to these platforms, I have a very good understanding of how they are implemented, what benefits they bring to a company, and what work is required to integrate them into a website.
